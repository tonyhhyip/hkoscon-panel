    In this talk, I’ll look at how the various open-source products in the
    Elastic stack can come together along with other software to build a
    complete IoT data processing back-end and potentially front-end.
  description:
    - This talk will take a quick whirlwind tour of the open-source products
    - 'that are part of the Elastic stack, with a focus on Beats, which are'
    - light-weight data shippers written in Go. These Beats are ideal as IoT
    - data producers/consumers.  We will look at how you can write your own
    - Beat relatively easily with our “beat generator” and then we will look
    - 'at a bunch of different deployment scenarios.  At the end of this talk,'
    - you will hopefully be able to get started writing your own Beats or
    - using existing ones and ultimately begin building your dream IoT data
    - pipeline with the Elastic stack.

    - '<p>In the IoT space, you can expect to be generating significant amounts'

    - processing and visualisation pipeline for that data so you can examine

    - '<p>In this workshop, we will explore creating a mock data processing'
    - pipeline using open data from the Hong Kong government.</p>
    - <p>What this workshop hopes to show you is how easily you can get up and
    - running with the Elastic stack and visualise and explore your data in
    - real-time.  Ultimately this workshop should provide you the foundations
    - to expand the example pipeline for your own data or other open source
    - data you find.</p>

      <p>MQTT is a lightweight publish/subscribe machine-to-machine protocol
      with a reliable bi-directional communication which provides near real-time
      notifications of events. The protocol is very convenient for Internet of
      Things as it has a small footprint and can run on devices with a
      constrained hardware capabilities such as the low cost WiFi micro
      controller ESP8266.</p>
    - >-
      <p>In this talk Leon Anavi and Arthur Chan will provide an overview of the
      protocol and its advanced features for web sockets, security, last will
      and testament. The presentation will provide guidelines for deployment to
      the cloud of popular open source MQTT brokers such as Mosquitto, HiveMQ
      and Mosca. Furthermore you will learn how to take advantage of open source
      MQTT clients implemented in various programming languages using the Paho
      project, writing your own Node.js, C or Lua MQTT client. The presentation
      will provide examples of MQTT on powerful embedded devices powered by both
      GNU/Linux distributions on Intel, ARM, MIPS SoC as well as on the cheap
      Wifi development module ESP8266.</p>

      <p>MQTT is a one of the popular messaging protocols for use on top of the
      TCP/IP protocol. It is convenient for near real time communication between
      Internet of Things. MQTT was invented in 1999 and initially it was used
      internally only by IBM. In 2010 version 3.1 was released royalty free and
      nowadays there are a lot of open source software MQTT brokers and
      clients.</p>
    - >-
      <p>The most popular open source MQTT brokers are Mosquitto, HiveMQ,
      ActiveMQ and Mosca. Mosquitto is an Eclipse incubating project and it is
      written in the C programming language. HiveMQ is written in Java and it
      know as a enterprise MQTT broker. Mosca is popular among web developers as
      it is written in JavaScript.</p>
    - >-
      <p>MQTT implements the publish-subscribe messaging pattern using a broker.
      All clients connect to the broker and subscribe to different topics. Each
      client is capable of publishing messages. The broker is responsible for
      delivering messages to subscribed clients. The work flow of a MQTT client
      is first to establish a connection with MQTT broker and after that to
      subscribe to a topic. At this point the client will receive messages from
      the broker depending on their topics. Furthermore, the client is capable
      of publishing messages at any time. Each MQTT message contains a topic
      which is used by the broker to forward it to the interested clients.
      Typically, the message also has a payload that could be a binary data,
      plain text, JSON, XML or anything else defined by the developer.</p>
    - >-
      <p>The Last Will and Testament (LWT) is an advanced MQTT feature to notify
      other clients about an ungracefully disconnected client. Upon connecting
      to the broker each client can specify MQTT message which will be its last
      will. The broker will store the message until it detects that the client
      has disconnected ungracefully. This way the developer can understand when
      Internet of Things have disappeared unexpectedly. Furthermore popular MQTT
      brokers also support web sockets so web developers can expose data
      instantly to HTML5 web pages.</p>
    - >-
      <p>Security if very important topic for Internet of Things. MQTT supports
      transport layer security (TLS/SSL) and authentication with username and
      password. Authorization policies can be implemented using access control
      lists. There is module for Mosquitto which allows integration with NoSQL
      and SQL databases.</p>

    national standard file format to exchange.  There are also several

    With the aging population worldwide, there has been a rapid increase of
    dependent patients who are either bed or house bound. More and more services
    are provided by hospitals and health-care organizations and allow doctors to
    provide diagnosis in patients' places in a regular basis. But the frequency
    is not high enough to provide timely diagnosis based on latest update of
    health condition. It brings us the idea to implement a cloud based system
    that can monitor health condition of users and allows doctors to provide
    timely diagnosis remotely.

    yajs.vim(Yet Another JavaScript Syntax) is one of the most powerful
    JavaScript syntax plug-in for Vim now. It supports lots of new syntax from
    ECMAScript 2015. This talk will explain the design, rules and limitation of
    Vim Syntax system. And under this environment, its not easy to highlight
    everything correctly.

    JavaScript is very important for the world wide web universe. But JavaScript
    support on Vim is not update very often. So I keep contribute to the Vim
    community. One of my contribution is yajs.vim(Yet Another JavaScript
    Syntax). One of the most powerful JavaScript syntax highlight plug-in for
    Vim now. It supports almost every new syntax from ECMAScript 2015, JSDoc,
    lots of new Web API and fixed several old issues. This talk will first
    explain Vim syntax system. The design, concept and limitation of it. Then
    will share the problems encountered during the development in this
    environment. And finally, how I solved these problems.

    FreeBSD is an advanced computer operating system used to power modern
    servers, desktops, and embedded platforms. A large community has continually
    developed it for more than thirty years. Its advanced networking, security,
    and storage features have made FreeBSD the platform of choice for many of
    the busiest web sites and most pervasive networking and storage devices.

      <p>I have spent several months working on packaging Haxe, a programming
      language, for various Linux distributions. I started from knowing nothing
      about Linux packaging to successfully got the packages accepted into
      Ubuntu/Debian, Arch Linux, Fedora, and openSUSE. The whole process may
      sound complicated and the concepts may be confusing to new comers. I will
      try to demystify the whole Linux packaging thing and detail how one should
      approach to delivering software to Linux systems. The knowledge would be
      useful for publishing any kind of software, including desktop application,
      command line utility, or software library.</p>
